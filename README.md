# Tangible Interaction Device

This device was developed for an university course about Embodied Interaction.
Its purpose is to complement long distance relationships' video calls with tangible interaction.

The device consits of a 3D printed ergonomic shape to rest a hand on. Inside it is an arduino, a ring of LEDs and a vibration motor.
The LEDs are RGB and the color can be changed by the users.
The vibration motor vibrates to mimic an heartbeat (we simulated it because we only developed one device but it could mimic the other person's heartbeat).
